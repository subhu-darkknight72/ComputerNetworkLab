## Assignment 1
- **Question 1:** A <code>TCP iterative server</code> to allow client programs to get the system date and time from the server. The client displays the date and time on the screen, and terminates.
- **Question 2:** Write a simple TCP iterative server and client to evaluate arithmetic expressions

## Assignment 2
- **Question 1:** A <code>UDP client-server</code> system to make the time server. However, the client uses the poll() function to wait for 3 seconds to receive on the UDP socket with timeout, else exits with “Timeout exceeded” message.
- **Question 2:** The client interacts with the <code>concurrent server</code> using a communication protocol: LOGIN, run valid shell commands on the server system, and display the output on the screen. Connection terminates when the client sends the command “quit” to the server.

## Assignment 3
- **Question 1:** A <code>UDP client-server</code> system to make the time server. However, the client uses the poll() function to wait for 3 seconds to receive on the UDP socket with timeout, else exits with “Timeout exceeded” message.
